# Feature Implementation

Implement the requested feature completely:

1. **Research**: Search codebase for similar patterns and existing implementations
2. **Plan**: Break down the feature into specific, actionable steps
3. **Implement**: Write all necessary code following project conventions
4. **Test**: Create or update tests for the new functionality
5. **Verify**: Run builds, lints, and tests to ensure everything works
6. **Integration**: Ensure the feature integrates properly with existing code

Focus on:
- Following existing code patterns and conventions in ${workspaceFolder}
- Using established libraries and utilities
- Writing production-ready, maintainable code
- Handling edge cases and errors appropriately

Complete the entire implementation, don't just provide code snippets.
